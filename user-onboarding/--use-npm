Success! Created user-onboarding at C:\lambda\unit2\DailyProjects\User-Onboarding\user-onboarding\user-onboarding
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd user-onboarding
  npm start

Happy hacking!
